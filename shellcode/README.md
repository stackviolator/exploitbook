Here I have created a reverse TCP connection in C then in MIPS Assembly then modified the assembly to remove the null bytes. 

To run the assembly executables, you must be on a MIPS machine or use emulation software, I used qemu-mipsel-static. 

Also include are a couple bash scripts I used to make the dev process a little easier.
